> **alOS** is *an open source 16-bit operating system* for x86 PCs, 
written in [Assembly language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language).

**alOS** is a 16-bit real mode operating system for x86-compatible PCs, 
written entirely in assembly language, which boots from a floppy disk,
CD-ROM or USB key. This operating system is a further development of
[MikeOS](http://mikeos.sourceforge.net/) & [TinkerOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJUGVFAXKg).

The code is completely open source (under a BSD-like license), 
and is written by [Suriyaa Kudo](https://j.mp/ItsSuriyaa), 
[Mike Saunders](mailto:okachi@gmail.com), [Tinkernut, LLC](http://www.tinkernut.com/) 
and [other developers](https://github.com/SuriyaaKudoIsc/animate-a-name/graphs/contributors) 
for the OS Laboratories Research of iSC Enterprise Group (iEG).

## Features
It features a text-based dialog-driven user interface, a command-line, 
support for FAT12 (MS-DOS-like) floppy disks, sound (PC speaker), 
text editor, BASIC interpreter and more.

> The kernel includes over 60 system calls.

## Usage
**alOS**is a learning tool and a research project by iEG OS Lab for those wishing
to understand simple OS construction and x86 assembly.

> *Quick getting-started guide:*
**alOS** can run from a floppy disk or CD-ROM, either on an emulator, on a a real PC or on Virtual Box, QUEMU or VM Workstation Player.
